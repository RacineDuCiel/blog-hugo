Overall Context: Technology is advancing rapidly, increasing connectivity (including critical infrastructure) and blurring boundaries. CASP&#43; professionals need ongoing awareness, situational analysis, and the ability to evaluate and integrate new technologies securely, considering performance, cost, and risk. This chapter focuses on analysis and impact. Objective 1.8: Impact of Emerging Technologies on Enterprise Security &amp; Privacy A. General Considerations
Impact: New tech brings new threats, governance challenges, and opportunities for attackers. Can be disruptive. Governance: Frameworks must be agile to keep up with rapid tech changes and provide policy/regulation guidance. Accessibility: Easy access/adoption can enable malicious use. ⠀B. Specific Emerging Technologies 1 Artificial Intelligence (AI): * Concept: Systems problem-solving and learning by analyzing input/data to simulate human intelligence. * Examples: Deloitte CortexAI (autonomous enterprise functions), Vaccine development research. Hardware optimization ongoing. 2 Machine Learning (ML): * Concept: Component of AI. Uses algorithms and large datasets to make predictions based on a learning model (without explicit rules). * Security Use: Identifying malware (heuristic, signature, etc.), predicting search queries. 3 Deep Learning: * Concept: Advanced ML mimicking human brain’s neural network structure. Solves complex problems, finds hidden patterns in large, tagged datasets. High accuracy focus. * Natural Language Processing (NLP): Deep learning &#43; linguistics. Enables computer understanding of human language (spoken/written). Examples: GPS, digital assistants, chatbots, Google Translate (imperfect). * Deep Fakes: Deep learning used to replace a person’s likeness in images/video. Risk: Disinformation (e.g., fake leader statements), impersonation. 4 Quantum Computing: * Concept: Uses quantum mechanics for computation/communication. Still evolving. * Security Impact: Potential to break classical crypto algorithms relying on factoring large primes (e.g., RSA). Quantum supremacy achieved (Jiuzhang example). * Synergy: Can enhance ML models with larger datasets; Deep Learning aids quantum research. 5 Blockchain: * Concept: Digitized, decentralized, public ledger (often for cryptocurrency transactions). Append-only blocks in chronological order. Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) implementation. * Function: Verifies transactions without central authority via distributed consensus (mining). Each node gets a copy. * Benefits: Enhanced security (immutable record), transparency, traceability, speed, reduced costs. * Use Cases: Cryptocurrency (Bitcoin), verifying authenticity of any digitized document/record. 6 Homomorphic Encryption (HE): * Concept: Allows computation on encrypted data, yielding an encrypted result that matches computation on plaintext, preserving privacy. * Subfields/Applications: * Private Information Retrieval (PIR): Retrieve item from DB without revealing what was retrieved.

Relies on cooperation; aborts if cheating detected. 7 Distributed Consensus: * Concept: Processes in a distributed system agreeing on specific data values during computation. Handles failures/errors. * Examples: Time synchronization, load balancing, aircraft control systems. 8 Big Data: * Concept: Extremely large datasets from diverse sources (Internet transactions, databases, mobile devices, IoT, social media, logs). Requires special tools/databases for analysis. * Tools: Splunk (log aggregation, evolved into big data analysis tool with Search Processing Language - SPL). 9 Virtual/Augmented Reality (VR/AR): * VR: Immersive simulated experience (headsets like Samsung Gear, Oculus). * AR: Digital content overlaid onto the real world (e.g., Pokémon GO, advertising). * Industry Uses: Gaming, Healthcare (surgical training, therapy), Military (simulations), Automotive (design review). * Security/Privacy Concerns: Vulnerable hardware/apps (payment/registration data), hacked live streams (surgery), malware in apps/platforms, data leakage. 10 3D Printing: * Concept: Additive manufacturing; building objects layer-by-layer from digital models using various materials (plastics, metals, ceramics, food). * Benefits: Rapid prototyping, custom parts (medical, aerospace, auto). * Cyber Threats: Intellectual Property (IP) theft (cloud designs, reverse engineering), Sabotage (modifying designs leading to part failure). Regulation/quality control challenges. 11 Passwordless Authentication: * Concept: Logging in without traditional passwords. Relies on other factors: Something you have (phone, token) or something you are (biometrics). * Challenges: Cost, user acceptance/skepticism. * Example: Disney World fingerprint ticket validation (suspended during pandemic). 12 Nanotechnology: * Concept: Science/technology at the nanoscale (billionths of a meter). * Applications: Crop fertilization, medical treatments, energy production. * Concerns: Potential health risks (DNA damage, crossing blood-brain barrier), diagnostic errors (“doctor on a chip”). Safety/security questions. 13 Biometric Impersonation &amp; Systems: * Process: Enrollment (capture sample) -&gt; Authentication Request (compare live sample to template) -&gt; Decision (match/no match). * Accuracy Metrics: * Type 1 Error / False Rejection Rate (FRR): Authorized user denied. * Type 2 Error / False Acceptance Rate (FAR): Unauthorized user accepted. * Crossover Error Rate (CER): Point where FRR = FAR. Lower CER = more accurate system. * System Types: Fingerprint, Hand Geometry, Palm Scan, Retina Pattern (accurate, intrusive, changes over time), Iris Recognition (accurate, less intrusive), Voice Recognition (vulnerable to recording), Keyboard Dynamics. * Considerations: User Acceptance (intrusiveness), Usability (processing time), Impersonation Risk (voice recording). * Data Management: Risk of storing sensitive biometric data in databases. Need secure decommissioning processes.">

<p>⠀<strong>Objective 3.1: Secure Enterprise Mobility Configurations</strong>
<strong>A. General Management &amp; Configuration</strong>
<strong>1</strong> <strong>Managed Configurations:</strong> Centralized control over mobile device settings using profiles/policies. Requires CASP+ guidance &amp; collaboration.
<strong>2</strong> <strong>Application Control:</strong>
* <strong>Application Wrapping:</strong> Adding management layer (policy enforcement, data sharing limits) around an app without modifying the app itself.
* <strong>Application Permissions:</strong> Controlling app access to device resources (camera, mic, contacts). Grant only if trusted/needed.
* <strong>Mobile Application Management (MAM):</strong> Software for IT control over enterprise apps (corporate/personal devices). Enforces policies, separates corporate/personal data, schedules updates. Needs clear policy on employee separation (remote wipe risk).
<strong>3</strong> <strong>Authentication:</strong>
* <strong>Password/Passcode Policy:</strong> Complex (&gt;=6 chars, avoid dictionary/repeats), use Password Managers.
* <strong>Multifactor Authentication (MFA):</strong> Require &gt;1 factor type (know, have, are). True MFA vs. 2-Step Verification.
* <strong>Token-Based Access:</strong> Using physical/software tokens for authentication. Limit failed attempts (lockout).
<strong>4</strong> <strong>Updates &amp; Patching:</strong>
* <strong>Patch Repository:</strong> Central source for managing/viewing mobile patches/baselines. Policy should align with vendor recommendations.
* <strong>Firmware Over-the-Air (OTA):</strong> Remote delivery of OS/firmware updates. Encrypted using device-specific key, stored securely to prevent cloning/downgrades.
<strong>5</strong> <strong>Remote Wipe:</strong> Erasing device data remotely (e.g., upon loss, theft, employee termination). Mitigates unauthorized use risk. Potential for accidental data loss.
<strong>6</strong> <strong>Wireless Security (WiFi):</strong>
* <strong>WPA3:</strong> Current standard. Uses 128-bit AES (or 192-bit mode). Requires Protected Management Frames (PMFs). Better than WEP (broken), WPA2 (insecure).
* <strong>WPA3 192-bit Mode Crypto:</strong> EAP-TLS (ECDH/ECDSA P-384), GCMP-256 (encryption), HMAC-SHA384 (key derivation), BIP-GMAC-256 (management frame protection).
* <strong>WIDS/WIPS:</strong> Detect/prevent rogue APs.
<strong>7</strong> <strong>Certificates &amp; Management:</strong>
* <strong>Purpose:</strong> Secure email, encryption, authentication (Wi-Fi, VPN).
* <strong>Deployment:</strong> MDM/EMM solutions streamline provisioning.
* <strong>SCEP (Simple Certificate Enrollment Protocol):</strong> Scalable but has cryptographic weaknesses (auth methods), risky in open environments like BYOD (unauthorized request risk - VU#971035).
<strong>8</strong> <strong>Configuration Profiles:</strong> Group of settings deployed remotely to manage devices consistently. Contains <strong>Payloads</strong> (subsets of settings, e.g., mail, security restrictions).
<strong>9</strong> <strong>Short-Range Wireless:</strong>
* <strong>Bluetooth:</strong> Short-range communication. Vulnerable. Version 5.0 (2 Mbps), LE Power Control/Audio (faster pairing, battery life). Used for tethering (slow), peripherals.
* <strong>Near-Field Communication (NFC):</strong> Very short range (&lt;4cm), low data rate (106-424 Kbps). Uses inductance. Used for data exchange (photos), mobile payments (&ldquo;tap to pay&rdquo;). Attack risk lower due to proximity. Disable when not needed.
<strong>10</strong> <strong>Mobile Payments:</strong>
* <strong>NFC-Enabled:</strong> Uses NFC coils/inductance.
* <strong>Mobile Wallets:</strong> Apps for managing/making mobile payments.
* <strong>Peripheral-Enabled:</strong> Using readers (e.g., EMV chip readers) connected to mobile devices.
<strong>11</strong> <strong>Peripherals Control:</strong> Restrict USB, Bluetooth, NFC, ports to mitigate data exfiltration risk. Includes smartphones, wearables, tablets when connected. (Also consider work-life balance aspect).
<strong>12</strong> <strong>Location-Based Controls &amp; Services:</strong>
* <strong>Geotagging:</strong> Embedding location data in files (photos). Default setting risk. Used by attackers (Creepy app, conflict zones).
* <strong>Geofencing:</strong> Triggering actions based on device crossing a defined boundary.
* <strong>Location Services:</strong> Apps using device location (GPS). <em>Privacy Risk:</em> Tracking user behavior/preferences, identity theft, unwarranted surveillance (law enforcement). Review privacy settings.
<strong>13</strong> <strong>Full Device Encryption (FDE):</strong> Encrypts entire device storage (OS, files). Protects data if device lost/stolen. Examples: EFS, BitLocker. Mandatory policy item. Takes time, requires password management.
<strong>14</strong> <strong>Tethering:</strong> Sharing one device&rsquo;s network connection (e.g., cellular) with others via Wi-Fi hotspot, Bluetooth, or USB.
* <em>Security Concern:</em> Connects potentially unmanaged devices to network. Unauthorized activation risk. Monitor for unauthorized use.
* <em>Carrier Issues:</em> Abuse of &ldquo;limitless&rdquo; data plans. Carriers may detect/charge/restrict tethering (&ldquo;fair use&rdquo; policy).
<strong>15</strong> <strong>Airplane Mode:</strong> Disables cellular, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, GPS. Required on flights (FCC). Protects against some attacks/tracking. Conserves battery.
<strong>16</strong> <strong>DNS Security:</strong>
* <strong>DNS over HTTPS (DoH):</strong> Encrypts DNS queries using HTTPS. Increases privacy/security.
* <strong>Custom DNS:</strong> Manually specifying DNS resolver IP addresses (faster/reliable servers, content filtering, ad blocking).</p>
<p>⠀<strong>B. Deployment Scenarios</strong>
<strong>1</strong> <strong>COBO (Corporate-Owned, Business Only):</strong> Company owns/dictates device and strictly controls content/use. Most secure, least flexible.
<strong>2</strong> <strong>COPE (Corporate-Owned, Personally Enabled):</strong> Company owns device, allows some personal use (apps, browsing). More freedom than COBO, security concerns increase.
<strong>3</strong> <strong>CYOD (Choose Your Own Device):</strong> Company offers limited choice of approved devices. Compromise between user preference (OS loyalty) and manageability. Doesn&rsquo;t guarantee app freedom.
<strong>4</strong> <strong>BYOD (Bring Your Own Device):</strong> Employees use personal devices for work. Most flexible, highest risk. Requires focus on access control and network security, not device management. (~60-70% adoption).</p>
<p>⠀<strong>C. Mobile Device Security Considerations</strong>
<strong>1</strong> <strong>Emergent Threats &amp; Attacks:</strong>
* <strong>Smartphone Malware:</strong> Slower adoption than PC malware (bandwidth limits, market fragmentation, shorter lifecycle) but growing as data capabilities increase. Vectors: Malicious sites, email attachments, social media links.
* <strong>Botnets:</strong> Using compromised mobile devices (zombies) for spam, DDoS, crypto mining, etc.
* <strong>Scareware:</strong> Fake/malicious software sold via deceptive marketing (fear tactics).
* <strong>Money Mules:</strong> Individuals transferring stolen funds/goods. Used by botnets (Zeus example).
* <strong>Smishing:</strong> Phishing via SMS messages.
* <strong>Search Engine Poisoning:</strong> Manipulating search results to lead users to malicious sites.
* <strong>Crimeware Kits:</strong> Toolkits for launching attacks (phishing, malware) without technical expertise.
* <strong>Clickjacking:</strong> Hiding malicious links/actions behind legitimate-looking elements.
<strong>2</strong> <strong>Specific Considerations:</strong>
* <strong>Unauthorized Remote Activation/Deactivation:</strong> Maliciously enabling/disabling features (camera, mic) or wiping device. Mitigation: Update OS, avoid unknown apps.
* <strong>Encrypted/Unencrypted Communications:</strong> Use built-in encryption, secure protocols (HTTPS, VPN, WPA3). Encryption process takes time, requires password management. Bluetooth encryption vulnerable.
* <strong>Physical Reconnaissance:</strong> Tracking location via GPS, call logs, SMS records (even deleted), social media geotagging, fitness trackers. Google tracking persists even if history off. Military base locations leaked via fitness trackers.
* <strong>Personal Data Theft:</strong> Via compromised apps, spyware. Includes call logs, SMS, photos, videos, contacts, browsing history.
* <strong>Unauthorized Application Stores:</strong> Bypassing official stores (Apple App Store, Google Play) increases risk of malicious apps.
* <strong>Jailbreaking (iOS) / Rooting (Android):</strong> Removing OS limitations. Allows unapproved software, custom configurations. Voids warranty, increases security risk. Scan devices for this.
* <strong>Sideloading:</strong> Installing apps outside official distribution channels. Bypasses security vetting. High risk.
* <strong>Containerization (Mobile Context):</strong> Isolating work apps/data from personal apps/data on a single device. Enhances security in BYOD/COPE. (Related to Docker concept in Ch 8, but applied to mobile OS).
* <strong>OEM &amp; Carrier Differences:</strong> Android ecosystem fragmentation (multiple OEMs - LG, Samsung; many carriers) leads to customization, bloatware, inconsistent updates. iOS (Apple) is a closed ecosystem (better app/accessory ecosystem, better privacy controls like tracking notifications). Both track user data.
* <strong>Supply Chain Issues:</strong> Risks associated with hardware/software components from various suppliers throughout the device lifecycle. Requires enterprise resilience planning beyond traditional IT BCDR.
* <strong>eFuse:</strong> Hardware chip feature allowing reprogramming/feature alteration in real-time. Used by vendors (Microsoft Xbox, Motorola phones) for anti-tampering (disabling jailbroken/modded devices).</p>
