Overall Goal: Implement enterprise security as a holistic framework, translating business requirements into executable security requirements using principles, methods, frameworks, and modeling for defense in depth. Move beyond basic perimeter security and antivirus. Objective 1.1: Secure Network Architecture Requirements &amp; Objectives A. Foundational Concepts
Need for Architecture: Build a strong foundation to reduce risk and protect assets. Hardening: Make attacker’s job difficult (remove unneeded services/ports, secure configurations, least privilege). Secure root/admin accounts are critical. Default accounts are a huge risk. TCP/IP Weaknesses: Designed for usability, not security. Many protocols lack encryption (clear text). Weaknesses in protocols or software implementations. Strategy: Balance needs, requirements, options, cost. Accept documented concessions based on risk/likelihood. Plan for resilience (e.g., backup facilities outside hurricane zones). ⠀B. Key Services &amp; Technologies 1 Load Balancer: * Purpose: Makes multiple systems appear as one resource. Provides redundancy, increased capacity (distributes load), allows rolling upgrades, centralized defense. * Proxy Load Balancer: Acts as reverse proxy, distributes traffic. * Layer 4: Uses Network/Transport layer info (IP, TCP, UDP). * Layer 7: Uses Application layer info (HTTP). * Function: Monitors health, sends requests only to responsive servers. Improves performance by offloading session management. 2 IDS/IPS (NIDS/HIDS/WIDS/WIPS): (NIST term: IDPS) * IDS (Intrusion Detection System): Gathers/analyzes info to detect intrusions. Passive. * IPS (Intrusion Prevention System): Builds on IDS; can react automatically to prevent intrusions. Active. * Detection Methods: * Signature Recognition (Misuse Detection): Matches activity against database of known attacks. Needs updates. Cannot detect unknown/polymorphic/encrypted attacks easily. (e.g., Snort). * Anomaly Detection (Heuristics/Behavior): Compares activity to a baseline of normal behavior. Can detect unknowns but may miss slow changes. * Protocol Decoding: Understands protocol specifications (TCP/IP stack) to find abnormal activity. Needs state information. Effective vs. custom stacks. * IDS Components: Sensors (collect), Central Monitor (analyze), Report Analysis (counteract), DB/Storage (trend analysis), Response Box (block/drop/redirect), Alert Definitions (rules), Alerts. * Snort Rules: Actions (alert, log, pass, activate, dynamic, drop, reject, sdrop). Custom rule types possible. Options (General, Payload, Nonpayload, Postdetection). * Thresholds: Fixed (numeric calculation), State-Based (change in metric state), Historical (compare current vs. past). * Alert Fatigue: Overwhelming number of alerts makes distinguishing true positives difficult. Tiered SOC response helps. Aggregation may be needed. * Sensor Placement: External (DMZ/Screened Subnet), Internal, Specific hosts, Inline (series). Determines detection scope. Needs tuning/baselining. * NIDS (Network IDS): Captures/analyzes network traffic. Inspects packets. Layer of defense. Cons: Blind to encrypted traffic (unless decrypted elsewhere), vulnerable to insertion/splicing/fragmentation attacks, high load issues. * HIDS (Host IDS): Monitors a specific computer system. Compares host activity to baseline. Resides on host. Pros: Can analyze decrypted traffic. Cons: Consumes host resources. * WIDS/WIPS (Wireless IDS/IPS): Focus on detecting/preventing rogue wireless devices. WIPS can actively block. Manual review recommended before blocking (avoid impacting neighbors). * INE/IME (Inline Network/Media Encryptor): High-security devices for strong (Type 1) encryption over networks (INE) or between CPU/disk (IME). Used in high-security environments. INE differs from VPN (not point-to-point). 3 WAF (Web Application Firewall): * Purpose: Protects web applications (not a replacement for traditional FW). Sits between client and web server. Analyzes Layer 7 traffic (HTTP, HTTPS, SOAP, XML). * Capabilities: Protects against XSS, SQLi, hidden field tampering, cookie poisoning. Deep packet inspection. * Detection: Signature-based or anomaly-based (vs. normal traffic patterns). * Tools: Examples: ModSecurity (open-source), Barracuda, Fortinet, Cisco. WAF detection/bypass tools exist (w3af, wafw00f). 4 NAC (Network Access Control): * Purpose: Verify device health/compliance before allowing network connection. Prevents/quarantines non-compliant devices. * Types: * Infrastructure-based: Requires hardware/OS upgrades (e.g., Cisco, Win 11). * Endpoint-based: Software agent on clients, managed centrally. * Hardware-based: Network appliance monitors behavior. * Agentless NAC: Policy enforcement integrated with authentication (e.g., AD); applied at logon/logoff. 5 VPN (Virtual Private Network): * Purpose: Secure, reliable transport over insecure networks (Internet). Encrypts data between endpoints. * Types: * Hardware-based: Dedicated appliance handles crypto. Good for site-to-site. Adds complexity/cost. * Software-based: Easy to implement. Relies on CPU. Good for smaller firms. May rely on 3rd party providers (control issue). * Protocols: * PPTP: Older, based on PPP. * IPsec: Network Layer (L3). Modes: Tunnel (entire packet encrypted, new header) vs. Transport (payload only encrypted, original header). Common for traditional VPNs. Requires client software. * SSL/TLS: Application Layer (L7). (Referred to as SSL VPN, but uses TLS). Common in browsers. Allows stricter, per-application access control. Simpler user setup, lower cost (no special client needed). * Access/Authentication (See also 1.5): * Centralized: Single entity verifies (e.g., RADIUS, Diameter). * Decentralized: Verification throughout system. * Protocols: RADIUS (older, modem pools -&gt; 802.1X/EAP), Diameter (RADIUS successor, IP mobility), PAP (clear text, insecure), CHAP (challenge-response, shared secret, better than PAP), MS-CHAPv2 (PPTP auth). LDAP/AD also used. * Placement: Parallel to Firewall (scalable, no central inspection), In Screened Subnet (FW inspects decrypted traffic, potential bottleneck), Integrated VPN/Firewall (easier mgmt, single point of failure risk unless mirrored). 6 DNSSEC (Domain Name System Security Extensions): * Purpose: Provide integrity and authentication for DNS responses (server identity). Digitally signs responses. * Requirements: Needs pre-distribution of authentication keys. * Limitations: Does NOT provide confidentiality. Does NOT protect against DDoS or domain hijacking. Authenticates server, not content (can still sign impersonated domain). * Context: Secures DNS beyond basic methods (internal/external servers, secure zone transfers - TCP 53). Addresses DNS vulnerabilities (cache poisoning, DoS). BIND alternatives (Unbound). 7 Firewall/UTM/NGFW: * Firewall (General): Hardware/software at boundary (trusted/untrusted). Uses rules (ACLs) for traffic control. * UTM (Unified Threat Management): All-in-one appliance (Firewall, NIPS, Gateway AV/Anti-spam, VPN, Content Filtering, Logging). Pros: Simplicity, single management console. Cons: Single point of failure. Placement: Network edge. * NGFW (Next-Generation Firewall): (Implied) More advanced firewall capabilities beyond basic ACLs (likely includes features found in UTM/IPS/WAF). 8 NAT Gateway / Internet Gateway: * NAT History: Addresses IPv4 exhaustion. Uses private IP ranges (RFC 1918: 10.0/8, 172.16/12, 192.168/16). * NAT Gateway (NGW): Enables devices in private subnet (no public IP) to connect outbound to Internet/cloud. Prevents inbound connections to those devices. * Internet Gateway (IGW): Allows instances with public IPs to connect to the Internet. 9 Forward/Transparent Proxy: * Definition: Server intercepts user connection to Internet. Does not modify requests/responses (transparent). * Purpose: Monitor user behavior, restrict access (content filtering), block malicious traffic. * Example: Squid. 10 Reverse Proxy: * Definition: Server sits at network edge. Client connects to proxy, proxy connects to origin server(s). * Purpose: Policy management, traffic routing, load balancing, scrubbing traffic (DDoS protection, WAF functionality), rerouting for availability. 11 DDoS Protection: * General: Mitigate crippling effects of DDoS attacks (service degradation, bandwidth/CPU exhaustion). * Techniques: Filtering (Reverse Proxy, WAF), Black Holing (RTBH filtering via routing protocols - send to Null0), ISP-level mitigation. CLDAP reflection example. 12 Routers: * Function: Layer 3 device, forwards packets based on destination IP using routing tables built by routing protocols (e.g., RIP, OSPF). Handles routable protocols (e.g., IP). * Security Risks: Misconfiguration, route poisoning, ICMP redirect attacks. * Security Controls: * Transport Security: IPsec, TLS/SSL for management/data. * Port Security (Switch feature): Layer 2 control. Limits number of source MACs per port. Deters adding unauthorized switches. * RTBH Filtering: Drop unwanted traffic (e.g., DDoS) using routing updates (send to Null0). * Trunking Security (Switch feature): Secure links carrying multiple VLANs (trunks - 802.1Q, ISL). Prevent VLAN hopping (attacker jumps VLANs). Mitigation: Disable DTP on user ports. * Route Protection: Ensure end-to-end network flow security (method depends on network type). 13 Mail Security: * Vulnerabilities: Clear text transmission, spoofing, spam, phishing, malware delivery. * Protocols: SMTP (send/relay, TCP 25 / Secure 587/465), POP3 (retrieve, TCP 110 / Secure 995), IMAP (retrieve, TCP 143 / Secure 993). Secure versions use SSL/TLS. * Protection: Encryption (PGP, S/MIME, SSL/TLS), Gateway Anti-spam/Antivirus (UTM feature). 14 API Gateway / XML Gateway: * API (Application Programming Interface): Interface definition for client/server communication. Vulnerable if not secured. * API Gateway: Sits between client &amp; backend service. Validates requests, routes traffic, acts as proxy, enforces policies (auth, rate limiting, input filtering). * XML Gateway: Entry point/proxy specifically for web services using XML messages. 15 Traffic Mirroring: * Cloud Context: Copies inbound/outbound traffic from cloud instances/LBs. * Purpose: Send copy to monitoring tools for content inspection, threat monitoring, troubleshooting. 16 SPAN Port / Port Mirroring: * Switch Context: Copies packets from specified switch port(s) to a dedicated monitoring port. * Purpose: Network analysis, troubleshooting (e.g., for NIDS, sniffers). 17 VPC (Virtual Private Cloud): * Definition: Logically isolated private cloud environment hosted within a public cloud. * Purpose: Enhanced security, granular control, customizable network environment. 18 Network Tap: * Definition: Hardware device inserted inline to passively copy traffic. Typically 4 ports (2 network inline, 2 monitor out). * Purpose: Monitoring, testing, troubleshooting without disrupting traffic flow. 19 Sensors: * Definition: Collects information (e.g., firewall log, network tap). * Purpose: Feed data analysis tools for defense decisions. * Types: Host-based (accurate, local), Network-based (broad coverage, potentially vulnerable). Redundancy needed. 20 SIEM (Security Information and Event Management): * Purpose: Centralized collection, analysis, correlation, reporting, storage of logs/events from multiple sources. Helps identify threats, manage alert fatigue. * Combines: SIM (long-term storage) &#43; SEM (real-time reporting). * Features: Alerting, aggregation, review, storage, visualization, pattern monitoring. * Challenges: Complex setup, requires multiple databases. * Vendors: ArcSight, Splunk, Lacework, Exabeam. 21 FIM (File Integrity Monitoring): * Purpose: Detect unauthorized changes to files. * Modes: * Agent-based: Real-time monitoring, uses host resources, efficient (only reports changes after baseline). Needs agent maintenance. * Agentless: Scheduled scans, no real-time detection, rescans entire system each time. Easier operation (no agents). 22 SNMP Traps: * SNMP Overview: Network management protocol (UDP 161/162). Agent reports stats to Manager. v1/v2 insecure (clear text community strings). v3 adds encryption. * Trap: Asynchronous alert message sent from Agent to Manager upon specific event (e.g., overheating, error condition). Used for monitoring. 23 NetFlow: * Purpose: Network flow analysis tool (orig. Cisco). Collects traffic metadata (source/dest IP/port, protocol, timestamps, volume). Helps identify anomalies (exfiltration, misconfigs, odd behavior) in near real time. Provides different perspective than packet capture. * IPFIX: IETF standard alternative to NetFlow. 24 DLP (Data Loss Prevention): * Purpose: Prevent sensitive data exfiltration. Analyze egress traffic for anomalies. * Requires: Data flow diagram for placement (often boundary device with deep packet inspection). Policies defining sensitive data. 25 Antivirus: * Purpose: Detect/eradicate malware. Essential first defense. * Detection: Signature-based (needs updates) vs. Heuristic/Behavioral (detects unknowns, uses AI/patterns). * Virus Techniques: Boot Record, Macro, Program, Multipartite infectors. Fast vs. Sparse infection. RAM-resident. Polymorphic (changes signature). * Mitigation: Keep AV updated (workstations, servers, mobile). End-user awareness training (attachments, unknown programs). Layered defense (zones). EICAR test file for verification. * Examples: Bitdefender, Trend Micro, Norton, McAfee.">

<p><strong>Overall Goal:</strong> Implement enterprise security as a holistic framework, translating business requirements into executable security requirements using principles, methods, frameworks, and modeling for defense in depth. Move beyond basic perimeter security and antivirus.
<strong>Objective 1.1: Secure Network Architecture Requirements &amp; Objectives</strong>
<strong>A. Foundational Concepts</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Need for Architecture:</strong> Build a strong foundation to reduce risk and protect assets.</li>
<li><strong>Hardening:</strong> Make attacker&rsquo;s job difficult (remove unneeded services/ports, secure configurations, least privilege). Secure root/admin accounts are critical. Default accounts are a huge risk.</li>
<li><strong>TCP/IP Weaknesses:</strong> Designed for usability, not security. Many protocols lack encryption (clear text). Weaknesses in protocols or software implementations.</li>
<li><strong>Strategy:</strong> Balance needs, requirements, options, cost. Accept documented concessions based on risk/likelihood. Plan for resilience (e.g., backup facilities outside hurricane zones).</li>
</ul>
<p>⠀<strong>B. Key Services &amp; Technologies</strong>
<strong>1</strong> <strong>Load Balancer:</strong>
* <strong>Purpose:</strong> Makes multiple systems appear as one resource. Provides redundancy, increased capacity (distributes load), allows rolling upgrades, centralized defense.
* <strong>Proxy Load Balancer:</strong> Acts as reverse proxy, distributes traffic.
* <em>Layer 4:</em> Uses Network/Transport layer info (IP, TCP, UDP).
* <em>Layer 7:</em> Uses Application layer info (HTTP).
* <strong>Function:</strong> Monitors health, sends requests only to responsive servers. Improves performance by offloading session management.
<strong>2</strong> <strong>IDS/IPS (NIDS/HIDS/WIDS/WIPS):</strong> (<em>NIST term: IDPS</em>)
* <strong>IDS (Intrusion Detection System):</strong> Gathers/analyzes info to detect intrusions. Passive.
* <strong>IPS (Intrusion Prevention System):</strong> Builds on IDS; can react automatically to <em>prevent</em> intrusions. Active.
* <strong>Detection Methods:</strong>
* <em>Signature Recognition (Misuse Detection):</em> Matches activity against database of known attacks. Needs updates. Cannot detect unknown/polymorphic/encrypted attacks easily. (e.g., Snort).
* <em>Anomaly Detection (Heuristics/Behavior):</em> Compares activity to a baseline of normal behavior. Can detect unknowns but may miss slow changes.
* <em>Protocol Decoding:</em> Understands protocol specifications (TCP/IP stack) to find abnormal activity. Needs state information. Effective vs. custom stacks.
* <strong>IDS Components:</strong> Sensors (collect), Central Monitor (analyze), Report Analysis (counteract), DB/Storage (trend analysis), Response Box (block/drop/redirect), Alert Definitions (rules), Alerts.
* <strong>Snort Rules:</strong> Actions (alert, log, pass, activate, dynamic, drop, reject, sdrop). Custom rule types possible. Options (General, Payload, Nonpayload, Postdetection).
* <strong>Thresholds:</strong> Fixed (numeric calculation), State-Based (change in metric state), Historical (compare current vs. past).
* <strong>Alert Fatigue:</strong> Overwhelming number of alerts makes distinguishing true positives difficult. Tiered SOC response helps. Aggregation may be needed.
* <strong>Sensor Placement:</strong> External (DMZ/Screened Subnet), Internal, Specific hosts, Inline (series). Determines detection scope. Needs tuning/baselining.
* <strong>NIDS (Network IDS):</strong> Captures/analyzes network traffic. Inspects packets. Layer of defense. <em>Cons:</em> Blind to encrypted traffic (unless decrypted elsewhere), vulnerable to insertion/splicing/fragmentation attacks, high load issues.
* <strong>HIDS (Host IDS):</strong> Monitors a specific computer system. Compares host activity to baseline. Resides on host. <em>Pros:</em> Can analyze decrypted traffic. <em>Cons:</em> Consumes host resources.
* <strong>WIDS/WIPS (Wireless IDS/IPS):</strong> Focus on detecting/preventing rogue wireless devices. WIPS can actively block. Manual review recommended before blocking (avoid impacting neighbors).
* <strong>INE/IME (Inline Network/Media Encryptor):</strong> High-security devices for strong (Type 1) encryption over networks (INE) or between CPU/disk (IME). Used in high-security environments. INE differs from VPN (not point-to-point).
<strong>3</strong> <strong>WAF (Web Application Firewall):</strong>
* <strong>Purpose:</strong> Protects web applications (not a replacement for traditional FW). Sits between client and web server. Analyzes Layer 7 traffic (HTTP, HTTPS, SOAP, XML).
* <strong>Capabilities:</strong> Protects against XSS, SQLi, hidden field tampering, cookie poisoning. Deep packet inspection.
* <strong>Detection:</strong> Signature-based or anomaly-based (vs. normal traffic patterns).
* <strong>Tools:</strong> Examples: ModSecurity (open-source), Barracuda, Fortinet, Cisco. WAF detection/bypass tools exist (w3af, wafw00f).
<strong>4</strong> <strong>NAC (Network Access Control):</strong>
* <strong>Purpose:</strong> Verify device health/compliance <em>before</em> allowing network connection. Prevents/quarantines non-compliant devices.
* <strong>Types:</strong>
* <em>Infrastructure-based:</em> Requires hardware/OS upgrades (e.g., Cisco, Win 11).
* <em>Endpoint-based:</em> Software agent on clients, managed centrally.
* <em>Hardware-based:</em> Network appliance monitors behavior.
* <strong>Agentless NAC:</strong> Policy enforcement integrated with authentication (e.g., AD); applied at logon/logoff.
<strong>5</strong> <strong>VPN (Virtual Private Network):</strong>
* <strong>Purpose:</strong> Secure, reliable transport over insecure networks (Internet). Encrypts data between endpoints.
* <strong>Types:</strong>
* <em>Hardware-based:</em> Dedicated appliance handles crypto. Good for site-to-site. Adds complexity/cost.
* <em>Software-based:</em> Easy to implement. Relies on CPU. Good for smaller firms. May rely on 3rd party providers (control issue).
* <strong>Protocols:</strong>
* <em>PPTP:</em> Older, based on PPP.
* <em>IPsec:</em> Network Layer (L3). Modes: Tunnel (entire packet encrypted, new header) vs. Transport (payload only encrypted, original header). Common for traditional VPNs. Requires client software.
* <em>SSL/TLS:</em> Application Layer (L7). (Referred to as SSL VPN, but uses TLS). Common in browsers. Allows stricter, per-application access control. Simpler user setup, lower cost (no special client needed).
* <strong>Access/Authentication (See also 1.5):</strong>
* <em>Centralized:</em> Single entity verifies (e.g., RADIUS, Diameter).
* <em>Decentralized:</em> Verification throughout system.
* <em>Protocols:</em> RADIUS (older, modem pools -&gt; 802.1X/EAP), Diameter (RADIUS successor, IP mobility), PAP (clear text, insecure), CHAP (challenge-response, shared secret, better than PAP), MS-CHAPv2 (PPTP auth). LDAP/AD also used.
* <strong>Placement:</strong> Parallel to Firewall (scalable, no central inspection), In Screened Subnet (FW inspects decrypted traffic, potential bottleneck), Integrated VPN/Firewall (easier mgmt, single point of failure risk unless mirrored).
<strong>6</strong> <strong>DNSSEC (Domain Name System Security Extensions):</strong>
* <strong>Purpose:</strong> Provide integrity and authentication for DNS responses (server identity). Digitally signs responses.
* <strong>Requirements:</strong> Needs pre-distribution of authentication keys.
* <strong>Limitations:</strong> Does <em>NOT</em> provide confidentiality. Does <em>NOT</em> protect against DDoS or domain hijacking. Authenticates server, not content (can still sign impersonated domain).
* <strong>Context:</strong> Secures DNS beyond basic methods (internal/external servers, secure zone transfers - TCP 53). Addresses DNS vulnerabilities (cache poisoning, DoS). BIND alternatives (Unbound).
<strong>7</strong> <strong>Firewall/UTM/NGFW:</strong>
* <strong>Firewall (General):</strong> Hardware/software at boundary (trusted/untrusted). Uses rules (ACLs) for traffic control.
* <strong>UTM (Unified Threat Management):</strong> All-in-one appliance (Firewall, NIPS, Gateway AV/Anti-spam, VPN, Content Filtering, Logging). <em>Pros:</em> Simplicity, single management console. <em>Cons:</em> Single point of failure. Placement: Network edge.
* <strong>NGFW (Next-Generation Firewall):</strong> (Implied) More advanced firewall capabilities beyond basic ACLs (likely includes features found in UTM/IPS/WAF).
<strong>8</strong> <strong>NAT Gateway / Internet Gateway:</strong>
* <strong>NAT History:</strong> Addresses IPv4 exhaustion. Uses private IP ranges (RFC 1918: 10.0/8, 172.16/12, 192.168/16).
* <strong>NAT Gateway (NGW):</strong> Enables devices in private subnet (no public IP) to connect outbound to Internet/cloud. Prevents inbound connections <em>to</em> those devices.
* <strong>Internet Gateway (IGW):</strong> Allows instances <em>with</em> public IPs to connect to the Internet.
<strong>9</strong> <strong>Forward/Transparent Proxy:</strong>
* <strong>Definition:</strong> Server intercepts user connection to Internet. Does <em>not</em> modify requests/responses (transparent).
* <strong>Purpose:</strong> Monitor user behavior, restrict access (content filtering), block malicious traffic.
* <strong>Example:</strong> Squid.
<strong>10</strong> <strong>Reverse Proxy:</strong>
* <strong>Definition:</strong> Server sits at network edge. Client connects to proxy, proxy connects to origin server(s).
* <strong>Purpose:</strong> Policy management, traffic routing, load balancing, scrubbing traffic (DDoS protection, WAF functionality), rerouting for availability.
<strong>11</strong> <strong>DDoS Protection:</strong>
* <strong>General:</strong> Mitigate crippling effects of DDoS attacks (service degradation, bandwidth/CPU exhaustion).
* <strong>Techniques:</strong> Filtering (Reverse Proxy, WAF), Black Holing (RTBH filtering via routing protocols - send to Null0), ISP-level mitigation. CLDAP reflection example.
<strong>12</strong> <strong>Routers:</strong>
* <strong>Function:</strong> Layer 3 device, forwards packets based on destination IP using routing tables built by routing protocols (e.g., RIP, OSPF). Handles routable protocols (e.g., IP).
* <strong>Security Risks:</strong> Misconfiguration, route poisoning, ICMP redirect attacks.
* <strong>Security Controls:</strong>
* <em>Transport Security:</em> IPsec, TLS/SSL for management/data.
* <em>Port Security (Switch feature):</em> Layer 2 control. Limits number of source MACs per port. Deters adding unauthorized switches.
* <em>RTBH Filtering:</em> Drop unwanted traffic (e.g., DDoS) using routing updates (send to Null0).
* <em>Trunking Security (Switch feature):</em> Secure links carrying multiple VLANs (trunks - 802.1Q, ISL). Prevent VLAN hopping (attacker jumps VLANs). Mitigation: Disable DTP on user ports.
* <em>Route Protection:</em> Ensure end-to-end network flow security (method depends on network type).
<strong>13</strong> <strong>Mail Security:</strong>
* <strong>Vulnerabilities:</strong> Clear text transmission, spoofing, spam, phishing, malware delivery.
* <strong>Protocols:</strong> SMTP (send/relay, TCP 25 / Secure 587/465), POP3 (retrieve, TCP 110 / Secure 995), IMAP (retrieve, TCP 143 / Secure 993). Secure versions use SSL/TLS.
* <strong>Protection:</strong> Encryption (PGP, S/MIME, SSL/TLS), Gateway Anti-spam/Antivirus (UTM feature).
<strong>14</strong> <strong>API Gateway / XML Gateway:</strong>
* <strong>API (Application Programming Interface):</strong> Interface definition for client/server communication. Vulnerable if not secured.
* <strong>API Gateway:</strong> Sits between client &amp; backend service. Validates requests, routes traffic, acts as proxy, enforces policies (auth, rate limiting, input filtering).
* <strong>XML Gateway:</strong> Entry point/proxy specifically for web services using XML messages.
<strong>15</strong> <strong>Traffic Mirroring:</strong>
* <strong>Cloud Context:</strong> Copies inbound/outbound traffic from cloud instances/LBs.
* <strong>Purpose:</strong> Send copy to monitoring tools for content inspection, threat monitoring, troubleshooting.
<strong>16</strong> <strong>SPAN Port / Port Mirroring:</strong>
* <strong>Switch Context:</strong> Copies packets from specified switch port(s) to a dedicated monitoring port.
* <strong>Purpose:</strong> Network analysis, troubleshooting (e.g., for NIDS, sniffers).
<strong>17</strong> <strong>VPC (Virtual Private Cloud):</strong>
* <strong>Definition:</strong> Logically isolated private cloud environment hosted within a public cloud.
* <strong>Purpose:</strong> Enhanced security, granular control, customizable network environment.
<strong>18</strong> <strong>Network Tap:</strong>
* <strong>Definition:</strong> Hardware device inserted inline to passively copy traffic. Typically 4 ports (2 network inline, 2 monitor out).
* <strong>Purpose:</strong> Monitoring, testing, troubleshooting without disrupting traffic flow.
<strong>19</strong> <strong>Sensors:</strong>
* <strong>Definition:</strong> Collects information (e.g., firewall log, network tap).
* <strong>Purpose:</strong> Feed data analysis tools for defense decisions.
* <strong>Types:</strong> Host-based (accurate, local), Network-based (broad coverage, potentially vulnerable). Redundancy needed.
<strong>20</strong> <strong>SIEM (Security Information and Event Management):</strong>
* <strong>Purpose:</strong> Centralized collection, analysis, correlation, reporting, storage of logs/events from multiple sources. Helps identify threats, manage alert fatigue.
* <strong>Combines:</strong> SIM (long-term storage) + SEM (real-time reporting).
* <strong>Features:</strong> Alerting, aggregation, review, storage, visualization, pattern monitoring.
* <strong>Challenges:</strong> Complex setup, requires multiple databases.
* <strong>Vendors:</strong> ArcSight, Splunk, Lacework, Exabeam.
<strong>21</strong> <strong>FIM (File Integrity Monitoring):</strong>
* <strong>Purpose:</strong> Detect unauthorized changes to files.
* <strong>Modes:</strong>
* <em>Agent-based:</em> Real-time monitoring, uses host resources, efficient (only reports changes after baseline). Needs agent maintenance.
* <em>Agentless:</em> Scheduled scans, no real-time detection, rescans entire system each time. Easier operation (no agents).
<strong>22</strong> <strong>SNMP Traps:</strong>
* <strong>SNMP Overview:</strong> Network management protocol (UDP 161/162). Agent reports stats to Manager. v1/v2 insecure (clear text community strings). v3 adds encryption.
* <strong>Trap:</strong> Asynchronous alert message sent from Agent to Manager upon specific event (e.g., overheating, error condition). Used for monitoring.
<strong>23</strong> <strong>NetFlow:</strong>
* <strong>Purpose:</strong> Network flow analysis tool (orig. Cisco). Collects traffic metadata (source/dest IP/port, protocol, timestamps, volume). Helps identify anomalies (exfiltration, misconfigs, odd behavior) in near real time. Provides different perspective than packet capture.
* <strong>IPFIX:</strong> IETF standard alternative to NetFlow.
<strong>24</strong> <strong>DLP (Data Loss Prevention):</strong>
* <strong>Purpose:</strong> Prevent sensitive data exfiltration. Analyze egress traffic for anomalies.
* <strong>Requires:</strong> Data flow diagram for placement (often boundary device with deep packet inspection). Policies defining sensitive data.
<strong>25</strong> <strong>Antivirus:</strong>
* <strong>Purpose:</strong> Detect/eradicate malware. Essential first defense.
* <strong>Detection:</strong> Signature-based (needs updates) vs. Heuristic/Behavioral (detects unknowns, uses AI/patterns).
* <strong>Virus Techniques:</strong> Boot Record, Macro, Program, Multipartite infectors. Fast vs. Sparse infection. RAM-resident. Polymorphic (changes signature).
* <strong>Mitigation:</strong> Keep AV updated (workstations, servers, mobile). End-user awareness training (attachments, unknown programs). Layered defense (zones). EICAR test file for verification.
* <strong>Examples:</strong> Bitdefender, Trend Micro, Norton, McAfee.</p>
<p>⠀<strong>C. Segmentation Strategies</strong>
<strong>1</strong> <strong>Segmentation (General):</strong> Place systems with different functions/security levels in different zones. Use security, network, or physical boundaries. Limits attacker lateral movement. Used in IR to isolate systems.
<strong>2</strong> <strong>Microsegmentation:</strong> Fine-grained segmentation within datacenters, allowing security controls per unique segment. Application-level security.
<strong>3</strong> <strong>LAN/VLAN:</strong> LAN (local network). VLAN (logical segmentation on switches based on port assignment). <em>Benefits:</em> Reduced congestion, smaller broadcast domains, security separation. <em>Risks:</em> VLAN hopping (mitigate by disabling DTP).
<strong>4</strong> <strong>Jump Box/Host/Server:</strong> Hardened system used as secure origin point for administrators to access systems in different/less trusted zones. Protects admin credentials. Evolving to SAW (Secure Admin Workstation). <em>Never</em> use for non-admin tasks.
<strong>5</strong> <strong>Screened Subnet (DMZ):</strong> Perimeter network between two firewalls (or using triple-homed firewall). Hosts public-facing services (web, email, DNS). Isolates internal network from direct Internet access.
<strong>6</strong> <strong>Data Zones:</strong> Creating layers of protection based on data sensitivity/location.
* <em>Vector-Oriented:</em> Focus on attack vectors (e.g., disable USB).
* <em>Info-Centric:</em> Layer controls on data itself (info, app, host, network controls).
* <em>Protected Enclaves:</em> Define critical areas with stronger controls (VPNs, FWs, VLANs, restricted access).
<strong>7</strong> <strong>Staging Environments:</strong> Test environment closely matching production. Used to test patches/updates before deployment to avoid breaking changes or introducing vulnerabilities. <em>Note:</em> Attackers may use delays to bypass staging detection (SolarWinds).
<strong>8</strong> <strong>Guest Environments:</strong> Separate network segment for visitors/unmanaged devices. Provides Internet access only (typically). Requires Terms of Use, security controls (MFA, timeouts, classification, permission reviews if sensitive access needed).
<strong>9</strong> <strong>VPC/VNET:</strong> Cloud-based segmentation. VPC (isolated section of public cloud). VNET (software-defined virtual network). Provides customer control over IP addressing, subnets, routing, firewall rules within the cloud.
<strong>10</strong> <strong>Availability Zone:</strong> Physically separate datacenters within a geographic region. Used for high availability and redundancy/failover.
<strong>11</strong> <strong>NAC Lists (ACLs):</strong> Firewall/router rules defining allowed/denied traffic based on criteria (IP, port, protocol, etc.). Processed top-down, implicit deny at end. Standard (source IP only) vs. Extended (more criteria). Basic data flow enforcement.
<strong>12</strong> <strong>Policies/Security Groups:</strong> Policies (high-level docs from management). Security Groups (Cloud term, e.g., AWS - rules controlling traffic to/from instances, act like host firewalls).
<strong>13</strong> <strong>Regions:</strong> Geographic segmentation for performance, compliance, defense-in-depth.
<strong>14</strong> <strong>Peer-to-Peer (P2P):</strong> Network architecture where nodes share workload equally. Used for file sharing. Hard to segment/control centrally.
<strong>15</strong> <strong>Air Gap:</strong> Physically isolating systems from any network connection. Highest level of segmentation. Vulnerable to physical/insider threats (e.g., Stuxnet via USB).
<strong>16</strong> <strong>Deperimeterization/Zero Trust:</strong> Security model assuming no implicit trust based on network location. &ldquo;Never trust, always verify.&rdquo; Requires strong authentication/authorization for every access attempt. Moves away from perimeter-based trust.
<strong>17</strong> <strong>Architecture Contexts Requiring Segmentation/Specific Controls:</strong>
* <em>Cloud:</em> Requires reliance on CSP controls, VPCs, Security Groups. Loss of traditional perimeter.
* <em>Remote Work:</em> Extends perimeter. Need VPNs, endpoint security, user awareness, adapted policies.
* <em>Mobile:</em> BYOT challenges. Need MDM, App Wrapping, Remote Wipe, VPN, Context-Aware Mgmt, secure config profiles. Address SCEP weakness, unsigned apps, sideloading risks.
* <em>Outsourcing/Contracting:</em> Requires vendor assessment, SLAs, clear data ownership/sovereignty, segmentation of vendor access.
* <em>Wireless/RF Networks:</em> Need secure protocols (WPA3), MAC filtering (optional), proper configuration, WIDS/WIPS.
* <em>Merging Networks (M&amp;A):</em> Integrate different security postures, policies, technologies. Requires careful planning/assessment.
* <em>Peering:</em> Direct connection between networks. Needs defined security agreements.
* <em>Cloud to On-Premises:</em> Requires secure connection methods (VPN, Direct Connect), careful policy integration.
* <em>Data Sensitivity Levels:</em> Drives segmentation strategy (e.g., place restricted data in highly segmented zone).
* <em>Cross-Domain:</em> Connecting systems of different security levels requires controlled interfaces/guards.
* <em>Federation:</em> Linking identity systems requires trust establishment and secure protocols (SAML, OpenID).
* <em>Directory Services:</em> Central identity source, needs securing (LDAP, AD).
* <em>SDN:</em> Centralized control plane needs securing. Offers potential for automated segmentation/policy enforcement.</p>
<p>⠀<strong>Objective 1.2: Infrastructure Security Design (Resiliency, Scalability, Performance)</strong>
<strong>1</strong> <strong>Scalability:</strong> Ability to handle growth.
* <em>Vertical:</em> Increase resources of existing system (CPU, RAM).
* <em>Horizontal:</em> Add more systems/instances.

* <em>Kerberos:</em> Ticket-based authentication protocol used in Windows domains (Active Directory). Provides SSO within realm.
* <em>OAuth:</em> Authorization framework. Allows application to obtain limited access to user&rsquo;s data on another service without sharing credentials.
* <em>802.1X:</em> Port-based NAC standard. Used for authenticating devices connecting to LAN/WLAN before granting access. Requires authenticator (switch/AP), supplicant (client), auth server (e.g., RADIUS).
* <em>EAP (Extensible Authentication Protocol):</em> Framework used within 802.1X to perform the actual authentication. Supports multiple methods (EAP-TLS, PEAP, EAP-TTLS).
<strong>5</strong> <strong>Multifactor Authentication (MFA):</strong> Using &gt;1 type of authentication factor.
* <em>Factors:</em> Something you know (password), have (token, phone), are (biometric).
* <em>2FA:</em> Specific type of MFA using exactly two factors.
* <em>2-Step Verification:</em> Often implies two steps of the <em>same</em> factor type (e.g., password + code via email/SMS), generally weaker than true MFA/2FA.
* <em>In-Band vs. Out-of-Band (OOB):</em> OOB uses a separate communication channel (e.g., phone call, SMS) for second factor, generally more secure.
* <em>OTP (One-Time Password):</em> Password valid for single use.
* <em>HOTP:</em> HMAC-based, counter synchronizes.
* <em>TOTP:</em> Time-based, time synchronizes.
<strong>6</strong> <strong>Hardware Root of Trust:</strong> Secure hardware component (e.g., TPM) that forms the basis for platform integrity and secure operations.
<strong>7</strong> <strong>Single Sign-On (SSO):</strong> Authenticate once to access multiple applications/services. Relies on trust relationship (e.g., Kerberos, SAML, OpenID Connect).
* <em>JWT (JSON Web Token):</em> Compact, URL-safe standard for representing claims securely between parties, often used in SSO/federation.
